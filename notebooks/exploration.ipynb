    "# SMS Spam Detection – Dataset Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief exploration of the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**  \n",
    "used to train the spam detection model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to better understand:\n",
    "- The structure of the dataset  \n",
    "- The distribution between spam and non-spam messages  \n",
    "- The typical characteristics of fraudulent SMS  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ham** → Legitimate, personal messages  \n",
    "- **spam** → Fraudulent or scam messages  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each row includes:\n",
    "1. A label (`spam` or `ham`)\n",
    "2. The message text\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spam vs Ham Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world data, legitimate messages are more frequent than spam.  \n",
    "This imbalance is important because it can influence how the model learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this distribution helps explain:\n",
    "- Why accuracy can be high even with a simple model  \n",
    "- Why precision and recall are also important metrics  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical Spam Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam SMS often contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Urgent language  \n",
    "- Promises of rewards or money  \n",
    "- Phone numbers or links  \n",
    "- Call-to-action phrases such as \"Call now\" or \"Claim your prize\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are what the machine learning model learns to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Message Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam messages are usually longer than normal messages  \n",
    "because they include more information, instructions, and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring message length helps us understand  \n",
    "why text-based features are useful for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on detecting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fraudulent SMS  \n",
    "- Scam messages  \n",
    "\n",
    "It does **not** currently classify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Legal marketing SMS  \n",
    "- Brand promotions  \n",
    "- Advertising campaigns  \n",
    "\n",
    "Future versions of the model could include these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is well-structured  \n",
    "- Spam messages follow recognizable patterns  \n",
    "- Machine learning is suitable for this classification task  \n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model uses these patterns  \n",
    "to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.\n"
